If we need more time for digesting certain topics, we can make space for that. Before each class period, please watch the indicated videos, complete required readings, and work through the Guiding Questions. Responses to these questions don‚Äôt need to be turned in, but we will leave time at the start of each class period for you to check in with classmates about concepts you found confusing or intriguing. Most readings are optional‚Äìthey complement ideas in the videos by presenting concepts in a different way. (Note that the PRIMER and WHATIF abbreviations refer to free online textbooks listed on the References page.) When a reading is required, it will marked as (REQD).
