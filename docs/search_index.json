Considering causes Given that we’re in a class called Causal Inference, it’s worth thinking deeply about the notions of causes and causation. Consider the word “cause” (and related phrases like “results in” and “leads to.”) What do you think “cause” means? How do you/people you know use it in day-to-day conversation and thinking? Why do we want to learn about causes? What should our goals be in learning about causes? Sinful saying or mandatory mantra? Correlation does not imply causation.

Days with higher ice cream sales tend to have higher crime rates. Individuals with larger shoe sizes tend to have better reading ability. Individuals who practice meditation tend to experience less stress. Individuals who regularly smoke cigarettes tend to develop lung cancer at higher rates than nonsmokers.

(Do they give identical information about X and Y?) Why or why not? Evaluating evidence for causation: Bradford Hill criteria In 1965, epidemiologist Sir Austin Bradford Hill propsed a set of nine criteria for evaluating evidence for a causal relationship.

Exercises Exercise 1 Suppose that we are trying to understand the causal effect of a personal finance course on the percent of earnings left in savings each month (abbreviated as “percent savings”). For the 500 people who took the course, we are able to collect data on percent savings and various other factors. We are also able to collect the same information from 500 people who did not take the course. Do you think that a comparison of percent savings in the course takers and non-takers would be a valid estimate of the average causal effect? Explain your viewpoint using the concepts of potential outcomes and exchangeability. One important factor to consider is the number of children that an individual has. Explain how this factor could contribute to a lack of exchangeability in the outcomes of the course takers and non-takers. As part of your explanation, discuss how observed outcomes compare to the missing potential outcomes. State any assumptions you make about the relationships between different factors. Do you think conditional exchangeability holds conditional on number of children? If yes, why? If no, what other factors might be needed to achieve conditional exchangeability? What is your thought process in thinking about other factors? Exercise 2 While \\(Y^a\\) denotes the potential outcome under treatment \\(A = a\\), \\(Y\\) denotes the observed outcome. (For the treated, \\(Y = Y^{a=1}\\). For the untreated, \\(Y = Y^{a=0}\\).) Is it possible for marginal exchangeability to hold but for \\(Y\\) and \\(A\\) to be dependent? Explain using a numerical or graphical example. Exercise 3 We have the data below on number of children (\\(Z\\)), treatment (course takers: \\(A = 1\\). course non-takers: \\(A = 0\\)), and the percent savings outcome (\\(Y^a\\)) categorized as either high (H) or low (L). Assuming that the course takers and non-takers are exchangeable conditional on number of children, estimate the average causal effect \\(P(Y^{a=1} = \\mathrm{high}) - P(Y^{a=0} = \\mathrm{high})\\). \\(n\\) \\(Z\\) \\(A\\) \\(Y\\) 10 2 1 7 H, 3 L 10 1 1 6 H, 4 L 10 0 1 5 H, 5 L 30 2 0 18 H, 12 L 40 1 0 20 H, 20 L 50 0 0 20 H, 30 L Exercise 4 Assuming that we have exchangeability of the course takers and non-takers conditional on number of children (\\(Z\\)) and use of public transportation (\\(W\\)), how might a regression model be used to estimate the average causal effect of the personal finance course?

Explain what assumptions they make to make statements about missing potential outcomes. Slides from today are available here. Exercises Peer check-in Start by checking on the guiding questions: Why are randomized experiments often called the “gold standard” for causal inference? What is the relationship between randomized experiments and exchangeability? Consider the quasi-experimental designs discussed in the video. How do these designs try to mimic randomization? What assumptions do they make to allow making statements about missing potential outcomes? What ideas were confusing, less clear, or intriguing? Make note of what your peers have noticed. This is a gold mine of information for your Metacognitive Reflections. Exercise 1 When dealing with an infection, should we suppress fever (e.g., with Tylenol or Motrin) or let the fever run its course? Randomized experiments have been used to examine this question. (Source 1, Source 2) Why might we want to use stratified randomization to examine the effect of fever suppressors on health outcomes? What variables might we want to stratify on and why? “Blinding” refers to the act of hiding from researchers and study participants the treatment group that the patients are actually in. Blinding is an important design consideration in randomized experiments. Suppose that hospital caregivers are not blinded and know whether a patient is receiving fever suppressors or not. How might this lead to a lack of exchangeability? What if patients knowing their treatment group? How might this lead to a lack of exchangeability? Compliance with assigned treatment is a practical concern in randomized experiments. What could be a reason for a patient’s lack of compliance with assigned treatment, and how might this affect exchangeability? Randomized trials with noncompliance can be viewed as an instrumental variables design. Explain this connection. (What is the instrument, and what is the treatment of interest?) Exercise 2 Radon is an element naturally found in air that can cause lung cancer. It has a very low concentration outdoors and can have higher concentrations indoors. When buying a home, a radon check is typically ordered to assess if the home needs a radon mitigation system installed (a system to reduce radon levels). If radon levels are above a certain threshold, a radon mitigation system is recommended. Given this context, what study design(s) might be used to study the effect of radon mitigation systems on lung cancer rates? Exercise 3 Interrupted time series analyses typically use models that can handle the correlated nature of time series data. (If you are curious about these methods, take STAT 452: Correlated Data!) For now, we can gain intuition for how these models are used in practice by examining linear regression models. The general form of a linear regression model for an interrupted time series design is below: \\[ E[Y \\mid T, I, A] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 T + \\beta_2 I + \\beta_3 TI + \\beta_4 A + \\beta_5 AT + \\beta_6 AI + \\beta_7 AIT \\] \\(Y\\): outcome/response variable \\(T\\): time \\(I\\): 1 if in the time period post-intervention, 0 for pre-intervention \\(A\\): 1 for treatment sites receiving the intervention, 0 for control sites Draw a figure showing the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(T\\) and showing how the slopes change over time and in between treatment vs. control sites. Label slopes, intercepts, and any changes or discontinuities with model coefficients. Ideally, control units should have pre-intervention trends that are as similar as possible to the pre-intervention trends for units that are treated. If this is the case, for which coefficients should we expect the confidence intervals to overlap zero? Which coefficients represent the causal effect of the intervention, and how can we interpret them?

Formulate use cases of simulation to understand causal inference concepts Slides from today are available here. Simulating data in R You can download a template RMarkdown file to start from here. Why simulate? Simulation is a very powerful tool for understanding statistical ideas. We can simulate (generate) data where we know the true underlying distribution, and we can then see how statistical methods perform on this data. For example: Do 95% confidence intervals really contain the true population value in 95% of samples? When is this not true? Does regression work to estimate causal effects when we have conditional exchangeability? Simulation functions in R R has functions to work with several probability distributions. For example, the following 4 functions work with the normal distribution: rnorm(): Generate a random number from a normal distribution pnorm(): Tail probability from a normal distribution dnorm(): Get density value from a normal distribution qnorm(): Get a quantile from a normal distribution There are r, p, d, and q functions for other distributions too (e.g., runif(), rbinom().) We’ll primarily use r functions to generate random numbers. rbinom(): # 4 different people each flip a fair coin once rbinom(4, size = 1, prob = 0.5) # 4 different people flip unfair coins # First 2 flip a coin with P(Heads) = 0.9 # Second 2 flip a coin with P(Heads) = 0.2 rbinom(4, size = 1, prob = c(0.9, 0.9, 0.2, 0.2)) # Write a command with rbinom() so that the result will definitively be 1,0,1 rnorm(): # 5 numbers from a normal distribution with mean 10 and SD 2 rnorm(5, mean = 10, sd = 2) # 3 numbers from 3 different normal distributions # Means = 10, 100, 1000.

We’ll step through how to simulate data that come from this causal graph. Question: Using the Causal Markov Assumption, how can we express the joint distribution of this data? Consider the structural equation model (SEM) below that is associated with our causal graph: \\[ \\begin{align*} Z &amp;\\sim N(\\mu_Z = 40, \\sigma_Z = 5) \\\\ A &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n = 1, p_A) \\\\ \\qquad &amp;\\log\\left(\\frac{p_A}{1-p_A}\\right) = -1 + 0.05Z \\\\ Y &amp;\\sim N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y = 1) \\\\ \\mu_Y &amp;= 30 + 5A + 2Z \\end{align*} \\] \\(Z\\) is an exogenous variable that follows a normal distribution with mean 40 and standard deviation 5. \\(A\\) is binary (binomial/Bernoulli) with probability of success \\(p_A\\) \\(p_A\\) depends on \\(Z\\) via a logistic regression model. \\(Y\\) is quantitative and follows a normal distribution.

Exercise 1 Write the joint distribution of the data from the causal graph below using the Causal Markov Assumption. Simulate data from the graph. You are free to choose your own structural equation model, but let \\(Z\\), \\(W\\), and \\(Y\\) be quantitative. Let \\(A\\) be binary. Use a sample size of 10,000 for your simulation. Use plots and summary measures to ensure that the simulated data have reasonable properties. Based on the structural equation model you chose, what would you guess is the average causal effect \\(E[Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}]\\)? Let’s consider simulating interventions using your SEM. If you were to force all study units to receive a certain value of treatment (either 0 or 1), how do you think the causal graph would change?

Check your answers to one of the graphs using DAGitty. Exercise 2 In this exercise, we’ll consider how causal graphs can inform study design. (Inspired by a 1970s study on the relationship between estrogen use and endometrial cancer.) Researchers have noticed a consistent association between use of a certain drug and disease. Research groups debated two hypotheses: The drug does cause disease. The drug doesn’t actually cause disease but leads to a side effect, leading to more frequent doctor visits, leading to increased diagnosis of existing disease. The following study plan was proposed: restrict the study only to those with side effects and compare disease rates in drug-users and non-users. In this way, all participants have the same chance of being diagnosed. The following causal graphs correspond to the two hypotheses: (The graphs don’t show confounders of the drug-true disease relationship for compactness. We can assume that these have already been adjusted for.) Study design 1 Consider the study proposal above: restrict analysis to those with side effects. Before looking at the causal graphs: does the rationale for this study design make sense? Why did researchers want to only look at patients with side effects? Under this study design, the researchers were expecting that if Hypothesis 1 were correct (the drug does cause disease), they would find an association between drug use and diagnosed disease. They expected that if Hypothesis 2 were correct (the drug does NOT cause disease), they would find NO association between drug use and diagnosed disease. Are these expectations correct? Explain in light of the causal graphs. Based on your answer above, is this an effective study design for the research questions of interest? That is, can this study proposal distinguish between the two hypotheses? Study design 2 Consider another study proposal: ensure that everyone is screened for disease frequently, and we don’t restrict our analysis to only those with side effects. What arrow can be removed as a result of this study design? (It might help to draw an updated version of DAGs 1 and 2 with this arrow removed.) Under this study design, the researchers had the same expectations: if Hypothesis 1 were correct, they would find an association between drug use and diagnosed disease. If Hypothesis 2 were correct, they would find NO association between drug use and diagnosed disease. Are these expectations correct? Explain in light of the causal graphs. Based on your answer above, is this an effective study design for the research questions of interest? That is, can this study proposal distinguish between the two hypotheses? Exercise 3 In 2020, a COVID-19 risk factory study received a lot of press for the surprising finding that smoking seemed protective for COVID-19 mortality. Dr. Eleanor Murray posted a series of Tweets diving into the situation from a causal graphs perspective. Read through her Tweets and discuss the following: How might we explain the paradoxical protective effect of smoking found in the risk factor study? Dr. Murray also discusses the importance of clarifying a causal question and the “Table 2 Fallacy.” Did any of these other ideas resonate with you, pique your curiosity, or leave you uncertain? Comment on the structure of the Tweetorial. What was effective and less effective? Would you have presented the information differently? Using different causal graphs? (If you feel inclined, put your ideas in Tweet form!) "],["the-smoking-birth-weight-paradox.html", "Topic 8 The Smoking-Birth Weight Paradox Our Task", " Topic 8 The Smoking-Birth Weight Paradox Slides from today are available here. Our Task Goal: Create a set of slides for a capstone-style presentation explaining the paradox in story form. Aim for the presentation to be fully accessible to STAT 451 students who have not read the paper, and to be somewhat accessible to STAT 155 students. Group roles: To facilitate our work today, it may be helpful to divide the work along the following group roles: Recorder: This person is crafting the slides (with guidance from others). This person creates the Google Slides file and shares it with the team and the instructor. Referencer: This person has the paper open to refer to key claims. Visioner: This person keeps the big picture in mind to guide the construction of the presentation. Facilitator: This person keeps everyone on track, manages time, and ensures that works is progressing at a good pace. Checker: This person monitors the accuracy of what has been created and keeps the guiding prompts below in mind, bringing them into the discussion when appropriate. Guiding prompts: Use these prompts to guide the crafting of your presentation to ensure that you consider key points: In all causal diagrams considered in this paper, no confounders of maternal smoking and mortality are shown. Given the intent of the paper, do you think this is a problem? Consider the choice and sequencing of causal diagrams presented in the paper. Which of Figures 3.1-3.6 will you choose to highlight in your presentation? (Figure 3.7 is the most complete and should go in your presentation.) It may help to use Figure 3.6 to outline your explanation before tackling the more complex Figure 3.7. Both collider stratification and relative effect magnitudes (strengths of relationships along individual arrows) will be important in your explanation. The discussions in the paper focus on the impacts of conditioning on Low birth weight = Yes. Do you think the paradox would hold if we condition on Low birth weight = No? (If time permits) Incorporate the alcoholism-liver cancer example at the end of the paper (just before the Discussion section). "],["building-causal-graphs-for-applied-analyses.html", "Topic 9 Building Causal Graphs for Applied Analyses Learning Goals Exercises", " Topic 9 Building Causal Graphs for Applied Analyses Learning Goals Practice building causal graphs to answer causal questions in an applied setting Exercises Data context In 2019, The New York Times featured research by a group who studied the effect of tenure-clock stopping policies on tenure outcomes. We’ll be looking at data from the study Equal but Inequitable: Who Benefits from Gender-Neutral Tenure Clock Stopping Policies? by Antecol, Bedard, and Stearns. The cases in the data represent individual faculty members in economics departments at top-50 schools. For each faculty member, we have information on several different tenure outcomes, career information, and school characteristics. Research questions: What is the effect of working at an institution with a gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policy on tenure outcomes? How is this effect different for men and women? (The authors only collected information on binary gender.) Collaborative causal graph construction Using the thought process described in our pre-class concept video, construct a causal graph that captures crucial information for our context. This will be hard. It will involve substantial discussion and uncertainty. All of this is part of the process. The instructor will serve as a subject-matter expert. Consult with her on any questions that arise. If you want to get up and move around, feel free to draw your DAG on the whiteboards. Others not at the whiteboard should record thoughts on DAGitty. Start by adding the treatment and outcome and identifying common causes of the treatment and outcome. To identify common causes, it can be helpful to start by just brainstorming causes of the outcome. Then determine if/how these causes might be related to treatment. Think through the common causes of pairs of variables that are not the treatment-outcome pair. This is likely harder than the previous step. And you may be worried about an infinite regress of common causes (when can we stop?!). If you are struggling to identify these common causes, it’s quite possible that they are of such small importance so as to not matter. You can check to see if including a common cause would actually change the conditional exchangeability set. As you go through this process, make note of what you are uncertain about and what aspects are hard. Not only is this useful metacognitive information, but it’s also likely that you are experiencing troubles that could be helped with further methodological and/or software development. Incorporate information on available variables Below is an abbreviated description of the variables available in our data. Goals for this phase: See which variables on your graph correspond directly to available variables. Replace the name of the variable on your graph with the variable name from the list below. Based on your graph, what variables are needed to achieve conditional exchangeability? If any of these variables did not have a direct mapping from Step 1, these may potentially be unobserved factors (threatening conditional exchangeability). Are there any variables below that would be good proxies/surrogates for those factors? If at the end of this process, you still have unobserved variables in your conditional exchangeability set, that’s fine. Just note what those are. (Later in the semester we’ll learn about tools for addressing the potential impact of unmeasured variables.) Treatment and primary outcome: gncs: Is a gender-neutral clock-stopping policy in place at this person’s school? (treatment) tenure_policy_school: Did this person get tenure at the university with the clock-stopping policy?

Pick one graph to focus on for the remainder of this analysis. Open DAGitty and paste the model code from the Google Doc into the “Model code” pane on the right. Click “Update DAG” to view the graph. Spend a short amount of time reviewing this graph to see if you generally agree with the relationships depicted. Make any updates that you think are sensible. (Again, keep this short - in practice, this should take weeks of thorough literature review and expert consultation.) If any variables do not directly correspond to available variables, find proxies for them. (Several variables may end up serving as a proxy for one unmeasured variable on your graph.) Based on this, decide on your final adjustment set. Part 2: Exploratory analysis Construct visualizations to inform your regression model specification. Your visualizations should: Explore nonlinear relationships between conditioning variables and the outcome Explore an interaction between one pair of conditioning variables. (To keep our analysis short) Note: All of the variables are coded as numeric, so if you need to make bar plots, you may need to wrap the variable name inside factor(), e.g., factor(female). The code below will be useful for exploring nonlinearity in covariate-outcome relationships. The blue smooth reflects observed data trends, and the red smooth shows the predictions from a logistic regression model with a specific model formula. Formula y ~ x: Covariate is included as a linear term Formula y ~ ns(x,3): Covariate is modeled with a flexible nonlinear function (a “spline” with 3 degrees of freedom–don’t worry about the details of this) The model predictions should generally align with observed data trends. If they don’t line up well using formula y ~ x, update the formula to y ~ ns(x, 3) to see if there is an improvement. ggplot(data, aes(x = covariate, y = tenure_policy_school)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = &quot;blue&quot;, method = &quot;loess&quot;) + geom_smooth(formula = INSERT_MODEL_FORMULA, method = &quot;glm&quot;, method.args = list(family=&quot;binomial&quot;), se = FALSE, color = &quot;red&quot; ) Part 3: Modeling Fit a model to estimate the overall average causal effect and another to estimate the subgroup average causal effects for males and females. (Recall: A*B in a model formula creates an interaction between A and B.) For both models, display the summarized output table and 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients of interest. Interpret the coefficients of interest on the natural (exponentiated) scale. mod_overall &lt;- glm(INSERT_MODEL_FORMULA, data = tenure, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) mod_bygender &lt;- glm(INSERT_MODEL_FORMULA, data = tenure, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) summary(mod_overall) summary(mod_bygender) # On the log scale confint(mod_overall) confint(mod_bygender) # On the natural scale confint(mod_overall) %&gt;% exp() confint(mod_bygender) %&gt;% exp() Part 4: Interpretation and discussion Using both the confidence intervals and effect magnitudes, discuss the results of your analysis in a contextually meaningful way. (Tie these results back to the research questions.) Discuss limitations of your analysis by acknowledging the points in the analysis process that were most uncertain. Simulation study planning Describe in detail how you would implement a simulation study to study the impact of model misspecfication (incorrect form) on the accuracy of regression for estimating causal effects. It may help to draw a specific small causal graph as the basis of your simulation.

Perform a causal analysis on a dataset of your choice. The methods you use for analysis will vary depending on your research questions and the structure of your data (e.g., different methods for quasi-experimental designs vs. general observational studies). You’ll plan your methods in collaboration with the instructor. A key part of all analyses will be sensitivity analyses to assess robustness of results to points of uncertainty in the analysis process. Resources for finding data: Google Dataset Search Harvard Dataverse Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) IPUMS Macalester’s librarians can also be a great resource for finding data. Schedule an appointment with them here. Option 2: Blog posts Collaboration: Individual only. Write two blog posts explaining causal inference ideas to a general audience. Post 1: A Tour of Causal Inference Which of our course ideas resonated most with you? Lead the reader through these topics in an engaging and cohesive way. Post 2: Pick any media item that has interested you. Write a reaction to it / an analysis of it from a causal inference perspective. If you’re looking to explore some media, the Casual Inference podcast is a fun one! Option 3: Learn an advanced topic Collaboration: Groups of up to 3. Individual work is fine. Dig deeper into existing course topics or learn a new topic. Examples could include: Methods for transportability (generalizability) of effects Interference Details of methods for time-varying treatments Specialized considerations for particular study designs Option 4: Other If none of these options piques your interest, I’m happy to discuss alternatives with you.
