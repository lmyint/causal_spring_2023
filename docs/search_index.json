As you discuss, add these noticings and your thoughts to the prompts to this Google Doc so that we have a shared class resource. Considering causes Given that we‚Äôre in a class called Causal Inference, it‚Äôs worth thinking deeply about the notions of causes and causation. Consider the word ‚Äúcause‚Äù (and related phrases like ‚Äúresults in‚Äù and ‚Äúleads to.‚Äù) What do you think ‚Äúcause‚Äù means? How do you/people you know use it in day-to-day conversation and thinking? Why do we want to learn about causes? What should our goals be in learning about causes? Sinful saying or mandatory mantra? Correlation does not imply causation. How has this saying come up in conversation for you? How do you feel about the value of this saying? Consider the following scenarios. What are your reactions to using this saying in each of them? Days with higher ice cream sales tend to have higher crime rates. Individuals with larger shoe sizes tend to have better reading ability. Individuals who practice meditation tend to experience less stress. Individuals who regularly smoke cigarettes tend to develop lung cancer at higher rates than nonsmokers. Sufficiency and necessity Consider the following statements: If X happens, then Y will happen. If X does not happen, then Y will not happen. Are these statements redundant? (Do they give identical information about X and Y?) Why or why not? Evaluating evidence for causation: Bradford Hill criteria In 1965, epidemiologist Sir Austin Bradford Hill propsed a set of nine criteria for evaluating evidence for a causal relationship. Let‚Äôs explore these criteria and reflect on how it fits into our mental frameworks on causation.

Exercises Exercise 1 Suppose that we are trying to understand the causal effect of a personal finance course on the percent of earnings left in savings each month (abbreviated as ‚Äúpercent savings‚Äù). For the 500 people who took the course, we are able to collect data on percent savings and various other factors. We are also able to collect the same information from 500 people who did not take the course. Do you think that a comparison of percent savings in the course takers and non-takers would be a valid estimate of the average causal effect? Explain your viewpoint using the concepts of potential outcomes and exchangeability. One important factor to consider is the number of children that an individual has. Explain how this factor could contribute to a lack of exchangeability in the outcomes of the course takers and non-takers. As part of your explanation, discuss how observed outcomes compare to the missing potential outcomes. State any assumptions you make about the relationships between different factors. Do you think conditional exchangeability holds conditional on number of children? If yes, why? If no, what other factors might be needed to achieve conditional exchangeability? What is your thought process in thinking about other factors? Exercise 2 While \\(Y^a\\) denotes the potential outcome under treatment \\(A = a\\), \\(Y\\) denotes the observed outcome. (For the treated, \\(Y = Y^{a=1}\\). For the untreated, \\(Y = Y^{a=0}\\).) Is it possible for marginal exchangeability to hold but for \\(Y\\) and \\(A\\) to be dependent? Explain using a numerical or graphical example. Exercise 3 We have the data below on number of children (\\(Z\\)), treatment (course takers: \\(A = 1\\). course non-takers: \\(A = 0\\)), and the percent savings outcome (\\(Y^a\\)) categorized as either high (H) or low (L). Assuming that the course takers and non-takers are exchangeable conditional on number of children, estimate the average causal effect \\(P(Y^{a=1} = \\mathrm{high}) - P(Y^{a=0} = \\mathrm{high})\\). \\(n\\) \\(Z\\) \\(A\\) \\(Y\\) 10 2 1 7 H, 3 L 10 1 1 6 H, 4 L 10 0 1 5 H, 5 L 30 2 0 18 H, 12 L 40 1 0 20 H, 20 L 50 0 0 20 H, 30 L Exercise 4 Assuming that we have exchangeability of the course takers and non-takers conditional on number of children (\\(Z\\)) and use of public transportation (\\(W\\)), how might a regression model be used to estimate the average causal effect of the personal finance course? Exercise 5 Exchangeability is a core assumption in causal inference. Do you think it is possible to test this assumption with data? If yes, how? If not, why not?

Explain what assumptions they make to make statements about missing potential outcomes. Slides from today are available here. Exercises Peer check-in Start by checking on the guiding questions: Why are randomized experiments often called the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù for causal inference? What is the relationship between randomized experiments and exchangeability? Consider the quasi-experimental designs discussed in the video. How do these designs try to mimic randomization? What assumptions do they make to allow making statements about missing potential outcomes? What ideas were confusing, less clear, or intriguing? Make note of what your peers have noticed. This is a gold mine of information for your Metacognitive Reflections. Exercise 1 When dealing with an infection, should we suppress fever (e.g., with Tylenol or Motrin) or let the fever run its course? Randomized experiments have been used to examine this question. (Source 1, Source 2) Why might we want to use stratified randomization to examine the effect of fever suppressors on health outcomes? What variables might we want to stratify on and why? ‚ÄúBlinding‚Äù refers to the act of hiding from researchers and study participants the treatment group that the patients are actually in. Blinding is an important design consideration in randomized experiments. Suppose that hospital caregivers are not blinded and know whether a patient is receiving fever suppressors or not. How might this lead to a lack of exchangeability? What if patients knowing their treatment group? How might this lead to a lack of exchangeability? Compliance with assigned treatment is a practical concern in randomized experiments. What could be a reason for a patient‚Äôs lack of compliance with assigned treatment, and how might this affect exchangeability? Randomized trials with noncompliance can be viewed as an instrumental variables design. Explain this connection. (What is the instrument, and what is the treatment of interest?) Exercise 2 Radon is an element naturally found in air that can cause lung cancer. It has a very low concentration outdoors and can have higher concentrations indoors. When buying a home, a radon check is typically ordered to assess if the home needs a radon mitigation system installed (a system to reduce radon levels). If radon levels are above a certain threshold, a radon mitigation system is recommended. Given this context, what study design(s) might be used to study the effect of radon mitigation systems on lung cancer rates? Exercise 3 Interrupted time series analyses typically use models that can handle the correlated nature of time series data. (If you are curious about these methods, take STAT 452: Correlated Data!) For now, we can gain intuition for how these models are used in practice by examining linear regression models. The general form of a linear regression model for an interrupted time series design is below: \\[ E[Y \\mid T, I, A] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 T + \\beta_2 I + \\beta_3 TI + \\beta_4 A + \\beta_5 AT + \\beta_6 AI + \\beta_7 AIT \\] \\(Y\\): outcome/response variable \\(T\\): time \\(I\\): 1 if in the time period post-intervention, 0 for pre-intervention \\(A\\): 1 for treatment sites receiving the intervention, 0 for control sites Draw a figure showing the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(T\\) and showing how the slopes change over time and in between treatment vs.¬†control sites. Label slopes, intercepts, and any changes or discontinuities with model coefficients. Ideally, control units should have pre-intervention trends that are as similar as possible to the pre-intervention trends for units that are treated. If this is the case, for which coefficients should we expect the confidence intervals to overlap zero? Which coefficients represent the causal effect of the intervention, and how can we interpret them? Extra If you have time, work on Part 4 of Homework 1, and get feedback from peers about your proposed study. "],["causal-graphs-as-statistical-models.html", "Topic 4 Causal Graphs as Statistical Models Learning Goals Simulating data in R Exercises", " Topic 4 Causal Graphs as Statistical Models Learning Goals Apply the Causal Markov assumption to express the joint distribution of data. Simulate data from causal graphs under linear and logistic regression structural equation models. Formulate use cases of simulation to understand causal inference concepts Slides from today are available here. Simulating data in R You can download a template RMarkdown file to start from here. Why simulate? Simulation is a very powerful tool for understanding statistical ideas. We can simulate (generate) data where we know the true underlying distribution, and we can then see how statistical methods perform on this data. For example: Do 95% confidence intervals really contain the true population value in 95% of samples? When is this not true? Does regression work to estimate causal effects when we have conditional exchangeability? Simulation functions in R R has functions to work with several probability distributions. For example, the following 4 functions work with the normal distribution: rnorm(): Generate a random number from a normal distribution pnorm(): Tail probability from a normal distribution dnorm(): Get density value from a normal distribution qnorm(): Get a quantile from a normal distribution There are r, p, d, and q functions for other distributions too (e.g., runif(), rbinom().) We‚Äôll primarily use r functions to generate random numbers. rbinom(): # 4 different people each flip a fair coin once rbinom(4, size = 1, prob = 0.5) # 4 different people flip unfair coins # First 2 flip a coin with P(Heads) = 0.9 # Second 2 flip a coin with P(Heads) = 0.2 rbinom(4, size = 1, prob = c(0.9, 0.9, 0.2, 0.2)) # Write a command with rbinom() so that the result will definitively be 1,0,1 rnorm(): # 5 numbers from a normal distribution with mean 10 and SD 2 rnorm(5, mean = 10, sd = 2) # 3 numbers from 3 different normal distributions # Means = 10, 100, 1000. SD = 1 rnorm(3, mean = c(10, 100, 1000), sd = 1) # Write a command with rnorm() so that the result will definitively be 10,20 Simulating data from graphs+SEMs In this course, we‚Äôll simulate data that come from graphs and their corresponding structural equation models. We‚Äôll step through how to simulate data that come from this causal graph. Question: Using the Causal Markov Assumption, how can we express the joint distribution of this data? Consider the structural equation model (SEM) below that is associated with our causal graph: \\[ \\begin{align*} Z &amp;\\sim N(\\mu_Z = 40, \\sigma_Z = 5) \\\\ A &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n = 1, p_A) \\\\ \\qquad &amp;\\log\\left(\\frac{p_A}{1-p_A}\\right) = -1 + 0.05Z \\\\ Y &amp;\\sim N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y = 1) \\\\ \\mu_Y &amp;= 30 + 5A + 2Z \\end{align*} \\] \\(Z\\) is an exogenous variable that follows a normal distribution with mean 40 and standard deviation 5. \\(A\\) is binary (binomial/Bernoulli) with probability of success \\(p_A\\) \\(p_A\\) depends on \\(Z\\) via a logistic regression model. \\(Y\\) is quantitative and follows a normal distribution. The mean \\(\\mu_Y\\) depends on \\(A\\) and \\(Z\\) via a linear regression model. Complete the code below to simulate data that follow this structural equation model. set.seed(451) # For reproducibility # Sample size n &lt;- 10000 # Simulate the Z variable Z &lt;- rnorm(?) # Simulate the A variable log_odds_A &lt;- -1 + 0.05*Z odds_A &lt;- exp(log_odds_A) p_A &lt;- odds_A/(1+odds_A) A &lt;- rbinom(?) # Simulate the Y variable mean_Y &lt;- 30 + ?

Exercise 1 Write the joint distribution of the data from the causal graph below using the Causal Markov Assumption. Simulate data from the graph. You are free to choose your own structural equation model, but let \\(Z\\), \\(W\\), and \\(Y\\) be quantitative. Let \\(A\\) be binary. Use a sample size of 10,000 for your simulation. Use plots and summary measures to ensure that the simulated data have reasonable properties. Based on the structural equation model you chose, what would you guess is the average causal effect of \\(A\\) on \\(Y\\)? Let‚Äôs consider simulating interventions using your SEM. If you were to force all study units to receive a certain value of treatment (either 0 or 1), how do you think the causal graph would change?
