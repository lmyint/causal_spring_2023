As you discuss, add these noticings and your thoughts to the prompts to this Google Doc so that we have a shared class resource. Considering causes Given that we’re in a class called Causal Inference, it’s worth thinking deeply about the notions of causes and causation. Consider the word “cause” (and related phrases like “results in” and “leads to.”) What do you think “cause” means? How do you/people you know use it in day-to-day conversation and thinking? Why do we want to learn about causes? What should our goals be in learning about causes? Sinful saying or mandatory mantra? Correlation does not imply causation. How has this saying come up in conversation for you? How do you feel about the value of this saying? Consider the following scenarios. What are your reactions to using this saying in each of them? Days with higher ice cream sales tend to have higher crime rates. Individuals with larger shoe sizes tend to have better reading ability. Individuals who practice meditation tend to experience less stress. Individuals who regularly smoke cigarettes tend to develop lung cancer at higher rates than nonsmokers. Sufficiency and necessity Consider the following statements: If X happens, then Y will happen. If X does not happen, then Y will not happen. Are these statements redundant? (Do they give identical information about X and Y?) Why or why not? Evaluating evidence for causation: Bradford Hill criteria In 1965, epidemiologist Sir Austin Bradford Hill propsed a set of nine criteria for evaluating evidence for a causal relationship. Let’s explore these criteria and reflect on how it fits into our mental frameworks on causation. Lucy D’Agostino McGowan has a fun presentation that explains Hill’s criteria through XKCD comics.

Exercises Exercise 1 Suppose that we are trying to understand the causal effect of a personal finance course on the percent of earnings left in savings each month (abbreviated as “percent savings”). For the 500 people who took the course, we are able to collect data on percent savings and various other factors. We are also able to collect the same information from 500 people who did not take the course. Do you think that a comparison of percent savings in the course takers and non-takers would be a valid estimate of the average causal effect? Explain your viewpoint using the concepts of potential outcomes and exchangeability. One important factor to consider is the number of children that an individual has. Explain how this factor could contribute to a lack of exchangeability in the outcomes of the course takers and non-takers. As part of your explanation, discuss how observed outcomes compare to the missing potential outcomes. State any assumptions you make about the relationships between different factors. Do you think conditional exchangeability holds conditional on number of children? If yes, why? If no, what other factors might be needed to achieve conditional exchangeability? What is your thought process in thinking about other factors? Exercise 2 While \\(Y^a\\) denotes the potential outcome under treatment \\(A = a\\), \\(Y\\) denotes the observed outcome. (For the treated, \\(Y = Y^{a=1}\\). For the untreated, \\(Y = Y^{a=0}\\).) Is it possible for marginal exchangeability to hold but for \\(Y\\) and \\(A\\) to be dependent? Explain using a numerical or graphical example. Exercise 3 We have the data below on number of children (\\(Z\\)), treatment (course takers: \\(A = 1\\). course non-takers: \\(A = 0\\)), and the percent savings outcome (\\(Y^a\\)) categorized as either high (H) or low (L). Assuming that the course takers and non-takers are exchangeable conditional on number of children, estimate the average causal effect \\(P(Y^{a=1} = \\mathrm{high}) - P(Y^{a=0} = \\mathrm{high})\\). \\(n\\) \\(Z\\) \\(A\\) \\(Y\\) 10 2 1 7 H, 3 L 10 1 1 6 H, 4 L 10 0 1 5 H, 5 L 30 2 0 18 H, 12 L 40 1 0 20 H, 20 L 50 0 0 20 H, 30 L Exercise 4 Assuming that we have exchangeability of the course takers and non-takers conditional on number of children (\\(Z\\)) and use of public transportation (\\(W\\)), how might a regression model be used to estimate the average causal effect of the personal finance course? Exercise 5 Exchangeability is a core assumption in causal inference. Do you think it is possible to test this assumption with data? If yes, how? If not, why not?

Explain what assumptions they make to make statements about missing potential outcomes. Slides from today are available here. Exercises Peer check-in Start by checking on the guiding questions: Why are randomized experiments often called the “gold standard” for causal inference? What is the relationship between randomized experiments and exchangeability? Consider the quasi-experimental designs discussed in the video. How do these designs try to mimic randomization? What assumptions do they make to allow making statements about missing potential outcomes? What ideas were confusing, less clear, or intriguing? Make note of what your peers have noticed. This is a gold mine of information for your Metacognitive Reflections. Exercise 1 When dealing with an infection, should we suppress fever (e.g., with Tylenol or Motrin) or let the fever run its course? Randomized experiments have been used to examine this question. (Source 1, Source 2) Why might we want to use stratified randomization to examine the effect of fever suppressors on health outcomes? What variables might we want to stratify on and why? “Blinding” refers to the act of hiding from researchers and study participants the treatment group that the patients are actually in. Blinding is an important design consideration in randomized experiments. Suppose that hospital caregivers are not blinded and know whether a patient is receiving fever suppressors or not. How might this lead to a lack of exchangeability? What if patients knowing their treatment group? How might this lead to a lack of exchangeability? Compliance with assigned treatment is a practical concern in randomized experiments. What could be a reason for a patient’s lack of compliance with assigned treatment, and how might this affect exchangeability? Randomized trials with noncompliance can be viewed as an instrumental variables design. Explain this connection. (What is the instrument, and what is the treatment of interest?) Exercise 2 Radon is an element naturally found in air that can cause lung cancer. It has a very low concentration outdoors and can have higher concentrations indoors. When buying a home, a radon check is typically ordered to assess if the home needs a radon mitigation system installed (a system to reduce radon levels). If radon levels are above a certain threshold, a radon mitigation system is recommended. Given this context, what study design(s) might be used to study the effect of radon mitigation systems on lung cancer rates? Exercise 3 Interrupted time series analyses typically use models that can handle the correlated nature of time series data. (If you are curious about these methods, take STAT 452: Correlated Data!) For now, we can gain intuition for how these models are used in practice by examining linear regression models. The general form of a linear regression model for an interrupted time series design is below: \\[ E[Y \\mid T, I, A] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 T + \\beta_2 I + \\beta_3 TI + \\beta_4 A + \\beta_5 AT + \\beta_6 AI + \\beta_7 AIT \\] \\(Y\\): outcome/response variable \\(T\\): time \\(I\\): 1 if in the time period post-intervention, 0 for pre-intervention \\(A\\): 1 for treatment sites receiving the intervention, 0 for control sites Draw a figure showing the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(T\\) and showing how the slopes change over time and in between treatment vs. control sites. Label slopes, intercepts, and any changes or discontinuities with model coefficients. Ideally, control units should have pre-intervention trends that are as similar as possible to the pre-intervention trends for units that are treated. If this is the case, for which coefficients should we expect the confidence intervals to overlap zero? Which coefficients represent the causal effect of the intervention, and how can we interpret them?

Simulate data from causal graphs under linear and logistic regression structural equation models. Formulate use cases of simulation to understand causal inference concepts Slides from today are available here. Simulating data in R You can download a template RMarkdown file to start from here. Why simulate? Simulation is a very powerful tool for understanding statistical ideas. We can simulate (generate) data where we know the true underlying distribution, and we can then see how statistical methods perform on this data. For example: Do 95% confidence intervals really contain the true population value in 95% of samples? When is this not true? Does regression work to estimate causal effects when we have conditional exchangeability? Simulation functions in R R has functions to work with several probability distributions. For example, the following 4 functions work with the normal distribution: rnorm(): Generate a random number from a normal distribution pnorm(): Tail probability from a normal distribution dnorm(): Get density value from a normal distribution qnorm(): Get a quantile from a normal distribution There are r, p, d, and q functions for other distributions too (e.g., runif(), rbinom().) We’ll primarily use r functions to generate random numbers. rbinom(): # 4 different people each flip a fair coin once rbinom(4, size = 1, prob = 0.5) # 4 different people flip unfair coins # First 2 flip a coin with P(Heads) = 0.9 # Second 2 flip a coin with P(Heads) = 0.2 rbinom(4, size = 1, prob = c(0.9, 0.9, 0.2, 0.2)) # Write a command with rbinom() so that the result will definitively be 1,0,1 rnorm(): # 5 numbers from a normal distribution with mean 10 and SD 2 rnorm(5, mean = 10, sd = 2) # 3 numbers from 3 different normal distributions # Means = 10, 100, 1000. SD = 1 rnorm(3, mean = c(10, 100, 1000), sd = 1) # Write a command with rnorm() so that the result will definitively be 10,20 Simulating data from graphs+SEMs In this course, we’ll simulate data that come from graphs and their corresponding structural equation models. We’ll step through how to simulate data that come from this causal graph. Question: Using the Causal Markov Assumption, how can we express the joint distribution of this data? Consider the structural equation model (SEM) below that is associated with our causal graph: \\[ \\begin{align*} Z &amp;\\sim N(\\mu_Z = 40, \\sigma_Z = 5) \\\\ A &amp;\\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n = 1, p_A) \\\\ \\qquad &amp;\\log\\left(\\frac{p_A}{1-p_A}\\right) = -1 + 0.05Z \\\\ Y &amp;\\sim N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma_Y = 1) \\\\ \\mu_Y &amp;= 30 + 5A + 2Z \\end{align*} \\] \\(Z\\) is an exogenous variable that follows a normal distribution with mean 40 and standard deviation 5. \\(A\\) is binary (binomial/Bernoulli) with probability of success \\(p_A\\) \\(p_A\\) depends on \\(Z\\) via a logistic regression model. \\(Y\\) is quantitative and follows a normal distribution.

Use plots and summary measures to ensure that the simulated data have reasonable properties. Based on the structural equation model you chose, what would you guess is the average causal effect \\(E[Y^{a=1} - Y^{a=0}]\\)? Let’s consider simulating interventions using your SEM. If you were to force all study units to receive a certain value of treatment (either 0 or 1), how do you think the causal graph would change?

Exercises Navigate to DAGitty and click the “Launch online” link. Exercise 1 First, think through the relationships depicted in the causal graphs below and whether they make sense. These are intended to reflect a range of scenarios for why people drop out of studies. Then for each of the graphs, identify the set of variables needed to achieve conditional exchangeability of the treatment \\(A\\) and outcome \\(Y\\). (\\(U\\) and \\(W\\) are unmeasured.) Check your answers to one of the graphs using DAGitty. Exercise 2 In this exercise, we’ll consider how causal graphs can inform study design. (Inspired by a 1970s study on the relationship between estrogen use and endometrial cancer.) Researchers have noticed a consistent association between use of a certain drug and disease. Research groups debated two hypotheses: The drug does cause disease. The drug doesn’t actually cause disease but leads to a side effect, leading to more frequent doctor visits, leading to increased diagnosis of existing disease. The following study plan was proposed: restrict the study only to those with side effects and compare disease rates in drug-users and non-users. In this way, all participants have the same chance of being diagnosed. The following causal graphs correspond to the two hypotheses: (The graphs don’t show confounders of the drug-true disease relationship for compactness. We can assume that these have already been adjusted for.) Study design 1 Consider the study proposal above: restrict analysis to those with side effects. Before looking at the causal graphs: does the rationale for this study design make sense? Why did researchers want to only look at patients with side effects? Under this study design, the researchers were expecting that if Hypothesis 1 were correct (the drug does cause disease), they would find an association between drug use and diagnosed disease. They expected that if Hypothesis 2 were correct (the drug does NOT cause disease), they would find NO association between drug use and diagnosed disease. Are these expectations correct? Explain in light of the causal graphs. Based on your answer above, is this an effective study design for the research questions of interest? That is, can this study proposal distinguish between the two hypotheses? Study design 2 Consider another study proposal: ensure that everyone is screened for disease frequently, and we don’t restrict our analysis to only those with side effects. What arrow can be removed as a result of this study design? (It might help to draw an updated version of DAGs 1 and 2 with this arrow removed.) Under this study design, the researchers had the same expectations: if Hypothesis 1 were correct, they would find an association between drug use and diagnosed disease. If Hypothesis 2 were correct, they would find NO association between drug use and diagnosed disease. Are these expectations correct? Explain in light of the causal graphs. Based on your answer above, is this an effective study design for the research questions of interest? That is, can this study proposal distinguish between the two hypotheses? Exercise 3 In 2020, a COVID-19 risk factory study received a lot of press for the surprising finding that smoking seemed protective for COVID-19 mortality. Dr. Eleanor Murray posted a series of Tweets diving into the situation from a causal graphs perspective. Read through her Tweets and discuss the following: How might we explain the paradoxical protective effect of smoking found in the risk factor study? Dr. Murray also discusses the importance of clarifying a causal question and the “Table 2 Fallacy.” Did any of these other ideas resonate with you, pique your curiosity, or leave you uncertain? Comment on the structure of the Tweetorial. What was effective and less effective? Would you have presented the information differently? Using different causal graphs?

"],["the-smoking-birth-weight-paradox.html", "Topic 8 The Smoking-Birth Weight Paradox Our Task", " Topic 8 The Smoking-Birth Weight Paradox Slides from today are available here. Our Task Goal: Create a set of slides for a capstone-style presentation explaining the paradox in story form. Aim for the presentation to be fully accessible to STAT 451 students who have not read the paper, and to be somewhat accessible to STAT 155 students. Group roles: To facilitate our work today, it may be helpful to divide the work along the following group roles: Recorder: This person is crafting the slides (with guidance from others). This person creates the Google Slides file and shares it with the team and the instructor. Referencer: This person has the paper open to refer to key claims. Visioner: This person keeps the big picture in mind to guide the construction of the presentation. Facilitator: This person keeps everyone on track, manages time, and ensures that works is progressing at a good pace. Checker: This person monitors the accuracy of what has been created and keeps the guiding prompts below in mind, bringing them into the discussion when appropriate. Guiding prompts: Use these prompts to guide the crafting of your presentation to ensure that you consider key points: In all causal diagrams considered in this paper, no confounders of maternal smoking and mortality are shown. Given the intent of the paper, do you think this is a problem? Consider the choice and sequencing of causal diagrams presented in the paper. Which of Figures 3.1-3.6 will you choose to highlight in your presentation? (Figure 3.7 is the most complete and should go in your presentation.) It may help to use Figure 3.6 to outline your explanation before tackling the more complex Figure 3.7. Both collider stratification and relative effect magnitudes (strengths of relationships along individual arrows) will be important in your explanation. The discussions in the paper focus on the impacts of conditioning on Low birth weight = Yes. Do you think the paradox would hold if we condition on Low birth weight = No? (If time permits) Incorporate the alcoholism-liver cancer example at the end of the paper (just before the Discussion section). "],["building-causal-graphs-for-applied-analyses.html", "Topic 9 Building Causal Graphs for Applied Analyses Learning Goals Exercises", " Topic 9 Building Causal Graphs for Applied Analyses Learning Goals Practice building causal graphs to answer causal questions in an applied setting Exercises Data context In 2019, The New York Times featured research by a group who studied the effect of tenure-clock stopping policies on tenure outcomes. We’ll be looking at data from the study Equal but Inequitable: Who Benefits from Gender-Neutral Tenure Clock Stopping Policies? by Antecol, Bedard, and Stearns. The cases in the data represent individual faculty members in economics departments at top-50 schools. For each faculty member, we have information on several different tenure outcomes, career information, and school characteristics. Research questions: What is the effect of working at an institution with a gender-neutral tenure clock stopping policy on tenure outcomes? How is this effect different for men and women? (The authors only collected information on binary gender.) Collaborative causal graph construction Using the thought process described in our pre-class concept video, construct a causal graph that captures crucial information for our context. This will be hard. It will involve substantial discussion and uncertainty. All of this is part of the process. The instructor will serve as a subject-matter expert. Consult with her on any questions that arise. If you want to get up and move around, feel free to draw your DAG on the whiteboards. Others not at the whiteboard should record thoughts on DAGitty. Start by adding the treatment and outcome and identifying common causes of the treatment and outcome. To identify common causes, it can be helpful to start by just brainstorming causes of the outcome. Then determine if/how these causes might be related to treatment. Think through the common causes of pairs of variables that are not the treatment-outcome pair. This is likely harder than the previous step. And you may be worried about an infinite regress of common causes (when can we stop?!). If you are struggling to identify these common causes, it’s quite possible that they are of such small importance so as to not matter. You can check to see if including a common cause would actually change the conditional exchangeability set. As you go through this process, make note of what you are uncertain about and what aspects are hard. Not only is this useful metacognitive information, but it’s also likely that you are experiencing troubles that could be helped with further methodological and/or software development. Incorporate information on available variables Below is an abbreviated description of the variables available in our data. Goals for this phase: See which variables on your graph correspond directly to available variables. Replace the name of the variable on your graph with the variable name from the list below. Based on your graph, what variables are needed to achieve conditional exchangeability? If any of these variables did not have a direct mapping from Step 1, these may potentially be unobserved factors (threatening conditional exchangeability). Are there any variables below that would be good proxies/surrogates for those factors? If at the end of this process, you still have unobserved variables in your conditional exchangeability set, that’s fine. Just note what those are. (Later in the semester we’ll learn about tools for addressing the potential impact of unmeasured variables.)

Pick one graph to focus on for the remainder of this analysis. Open DAGitty and paste the model code from the Google Doc into the “Model code” pane on the right. Click “Update DAG” to view the graph. Spend a short amount of time reviewing this graph to see if you generally agree with the relationships depicted. Make any updates that you think are sensible. (Again, keep this short - in practice, this should take weeks of thorough literature review and expert consultation.) If any variables do not directly correspond to available variables, find proxies for them. (Several variables may end up serving as a proxy for one unmeasured variable on your graph.) Based on this, decide on your final adjustment set. Part 2: Exploratory analysis Construct visualizations to inform your regression model specification. Your visualizations should: Explore nonlinear relationships between conditioning variables and the outcome Explore an interaction between one pair of conditioning variables. (To keep our analysis short) Note: All of the variables are coded as numeric, so if you need to make bar plots, you may need to wrap the variable name inside factor(), e.g., factor(female). The code below will be useful for exploring nonlinearity in covariate-outcome relationships. The blue smooth reflects observed data trends, and the red smooth shows the predictions from a logistic regression model with a specific model formula. Formula y ~ x: Covariate is included as a linear term Formula y ~ ns(x,3): Covariate is modeled with a flexible nonlinear function (a “spline” with 3 degrees of freedom–don’t worry about the details of this) The model predictions should generally align with observed data trends. If they don’t line up well using formula y ~ x, update the formula to y ~ ns(x, 3) to see if there is an improvement. ggplot(data, aes(x = covariate, y = tenure_policy_school)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = &quot;blue&quot;, method = &quot;loess&quot;) + geom_smooth(formula = INSERT_MODEL_FORMULA, method = &quot;glm&quot;, method.args = list(family=&quot;binomial&quot;), se = FALSE, color = &quot;red&quot; ) Part 3: Modeling Fit a model to estimate the overall average causal effect and another to estimate the subgroup average causal effects for males and females. (Recall: A*B in a model formula creates an interaction between A and B.) For both models, display the summarized output table and 95% confidence intervals for the coefficients of interest. Interpret the coefficients of interest on the natural (exponentiated) scale. mod_overall &lt;- glm(INSERT_MODEL_FORMULA, data = tenure, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) mod_bygender &lt;- glm(INSERT_MODEL_FORMULA, data = tenure, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) summary(mod_overall) summary(mod_bygender) # On the log scale confint(mod_overall) confint(mod_bygender) # On the natural scale confint(mod_overall) %&gt;% exp() confint(mod_bygender) %&gt;% exp() Part 4: Interpretation and discussion Using both the confidence intervals and effect magnitudes, discuss the results of your analysis in a contextually meaningful way. (Tie these results back to the research questions.) Discuss limitations of your analysis by acknowledging the points in the analysis process that were most uncertain. Simulation study planning Describe in detail how you would implement a simulation study to study the impact of model misspecfication (incorrect form) on the accuracy of regression for estimating causal effects.

The accuracy of IPW depends on having the right model for treatment as a function of the variables needed to achieve conditional exchangeability. Based on our simulation, what is the correct logistic regression model that should be fit? Fit this model as ps_mod_complex. Also fit a wrong model called ps_mod_simple that uses the formula A ~ Z + W. (In this way, we can explore the impact of model misspecification.) The code below uses your models to compute (right and wrong) IP weights. predict(logistic_mod, newdata = data_to_make_predictions_for, type = \"response\") is used to predict probabilities from a logistic regression model. (Without type = \"response\", log-odds are computed.)

Is the estimated ACE what you expected? Incorporate the IP weights into your analysis by modifying your model from part c as below. (As discussed in 12.4 of WHATIF, this weighting fits a marginal structural model (MSM) that allows us to directly estimate the ACE.)

Models from one of our analyses are displayed here. Review the results of this analysis by interpreting the relevant coefficients and confidence intervals on the odds ratio scale. # Overall ACE mod_overall &lt;- glm(tenure_policy_school ~ gncs + ns(female_ratio, 3) + ns(full_ratio, 3) + factor(max_csstops)*female, data = tenure, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) summary(mod_overall) confint(mod_overall) # Subgroup ACEs mod_subgroup &lt;- glm(tenure_policy_school ~ gncs*female + ns(female_ratio, 3) + ns(full_ratio, 3) + factor(max_csstops)*female, data = tenure, family = &quot;binomial&quot;) summary(mod_subgroup) confint(mod_subgroup) Part 2: Propensity score modeling We will assume that the revenue, female_ratio, full_ratio, and max_csstops are sufficient (proxies for) variables needed to achieve conditional exchangeability. (female was included in the outcome regresion models for assessing subgroup effects but wasn’t determined to be part of a noncausal path in our causal graph analysis.) Fit an appropriate propensity score model called ps_mod. Use visualizations to inform the construction of your model. (Just focus on appropriately handling nonlinearity.) Use your model to compute appropriate weights, and add these weights to the dataset. Use “before and after” visualizations to compare balance of key variables before and after weighting. You’ll need to use factor(gncs) to make your visualizations–this forces R to view gncs as a categorical variable. Note: If any distributions look dissimilar after weighting, this is an indication that the propensity score model may be misspecified. We won’t address this in our analysis today for time reasons, but in practice, more flexible modeling techniques would be explored. Coding notes: The code below will be useful for exploring nonlinearity in covariate-treatment relationships. The blue smooth reflects observed data trends, and the red smooth shows the predictions from a logistic regression model with a specific model formula. Formula y ~ x: Covariate is included as a linear term Formula y ~ ns(x,3): Covariate is modeled with a flexible nonlinear function (a “spline” with 3 degrees of freedom–don’t worry about the details of this) The model predictions should generally align with observed data trends. If they don’t line up well using formula y ~ x, update the formula to y ~ ns(x, 3) to see if there is an improvement. ggplot(DATA, aes(x = COVARIATE, y = OUTCOME)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = &quot;blue&quot;, method = &quot;loess&quot;) + geom_smooth(formula = INSERT_MODEL_FORMULA, method = &quot;glm&quot;, method.args = list(family=&quot;binomial&quot;), se = FALSE, color = &quot;red&quot; ) The (incomplete) code below is useful for computing appropriate weights: DATA &lt;- DATA %&gt;% mutate( ps = predict(ps_mod, newdata = DATA, type = &quot;response&quot;), ipw = case_when( TREAT_VAR==1 ~ ???, TREAT_VAR==0 ~ ??? ) ) You can incorporate weights into most ggplot2 figures by adding weight to the aesthetics: aes(..., weight = ip_weight) Part 3: Modeling with IP weights We can use the IP weights constructed above in a weighted regression model to estimate causal effects. Note: The svydesign() and svyglm() functions from the survey package are used to ensure that the weights are treated appropriately. (An updated (“robust”) standard error calculation method is used to appropriately account for the fact that the IP weights are estimated and have uncertainty.) Note that we are removing cases with missing values for the weights. (These cases had missing values in the covariates used in the propensity score model.) You’ll think about whether this biases the analysis in Part 4. The code for estimating the overall ACE is complete. Adapt this code to estimate subgroup ACEs in males and females. Using both the confidence intervals and effect magnitudes, discuss the results of your analysis in a contextually meaningful way. (Tie these results back to the research questions.)

Exercises Exercise 1 For those of you working on a data analysis (or a plan of a data analysis) for the final project, share your data context and research questions with others. Mediation Brainstorm some research questions that could be answered in a mediation analysis framework. What mediators would be of interest? (That is, what direct and indirect effects would be of interest?) How realistic would it be to collect data on those mediators? Time-varying treatments Brainstorm some research questions that could be answered in a time-varying treatments framework. Is it more useful to consider time-fixed or time-varying treatments in your context? How realistic would it be to collect the longitudinal data needed for a time-varying treatments analysis? Exercise 2 The following causal graph shows a time-varying treatment setting where treatment is measured at two time points (A0 and A1). It depicts a common occurrence in longitudinal data: treatment-confounder feedback. This is when past treatment \\(A_{t-1}\\) affects the value of future confounders \\(L_{t}\\). Using causal graph ideas, explain why a regression model of the form \\(E[Y \\mid A_0, A_1, L_1]\\) creates a problem for estimating the effect of a treatment strategy for \\(A_0\\) and \\(A_1\\). How would you expect this graph to change under inverse probability weighting? Why does IPW allow us to estimate the effect of a treatment strategy for \\(A_0\\) and \\(A_1\\)? Exercise 3 In mediation analysis, a common first instinct to estimate direct effects is to control for the mediator by including it in a regression model. Let’s explore this intuition by examining the following causal graph. Based on this graph, what considerations need to be kept in mind in order for this approach to validly estimate a direct effect?

Conduct and communicate the results of a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding. Slides from today are available here. Example with the tipr package Let’s go through a sensitivity analysis for the results of our tenure policy study. We estimated a causal odds ratio of 1.65 in our tenure policy analyses. An unmeasured confounder that we might concerned about is “harshness of external reviewers.” We might conceive of quantifying this as the reviewers’ expectation of number of publications in the pre-tenure time period.

Metacognitive Reflection (REQD) For this reflection, check in on your understanding of our new topics in light of the breakdown below (which you can disagree with!). (Do this reflection after the main exercises.) Enduring concepts: Why do we do sensitivity analyses for unmeasured variables and how, in general, do we interpret results? What is the goal of causal discovery? Important concepts: Making connections between the probability underlying casual graphs and why we need to specify parameters in sensitivity analyses Details of how the causal discovery algorithm covered in the concept video Concepts worth being familiar with: What do you think should go under this category? Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding (REQD) Context Does smoking actually cause lung cancer? There was great debate in the 1950s and 1960s on this issue. A prominent statistician R. A. Fisher (a longtime smoker) was dubious of the actual causal relationship and proposed that some genetic variant might be more common in smokers and also increase lung cancer risk. In the paper Smoking and lung cancer: recent evidence and a discussion of some questions, Jerome Cornfield and co-authors report on a sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding to address Fisher’s proposition (second column on page 1186). We’ll corroborate these results in this exercise. Implementation with tipr Use the adjust_rr_with_binary() function in the tipr package to implement a sensitivity analysis. rr stands for relative risk and is a probability ratio (as opposed to an odds ratio). Relative risks are alternate effect measures for binary outcomes. First look at the documentation for this function. Note that because our causal effect is a relative risk, the confounder_outcome_effect is also quantified with a relative risk. Use the seq() function to generate a sequence of regularly spaced values for the exposed_confounder_prev, unexposed_confounder_prev, and confounder_outcome_effect arguments. Look at the documentation for the seq() function to understand how the arguments work. The only background information that we’re starting with is A recent study suggests that the causal effect (before considering any unmeasured confounders) is a relative risk of about 7. library(tidyverse) library(tipr) # This creates all combinations of values across the 3 parameters parameter_combos &lt;- tidyr::crossing( exposed_confounder_prev = seq(from = ___, to = ___, by = ___), unexposed_confounder_prev = seq(from = ___, to = ___, by = ___), confounder_outcome_effect = seq(from = ___, to = ___, by = ___) ) # Use dplyr::filter() to remove combinations that won&#39;t &quot;explain away&quot; (make null) the observed causal effect # i.e., make sure that the parameters indicate the correct sign of the U-&gt;A relationship parameter_combos &lt;- parameter_combos %&gt;% filter() # Run sensitivity analysis sens_results &lt;- adjust_rr_with_binary( effect_observed = ___, exposed_confounder_prev = parameter_combos$exposed_confounder_prev, unexposed_confounder_prev = parameter_combos$unexposed_confounder_prev, confounder_outcome_effect = parameter_combos$confounder_outcome_effect, verbose = FALSE ) Visualize Visualize the sensitivity analysis results in a way that you find effective. The instructor found it helpful to collapse the exposed_confounder_prev and unexposed_confounder_prev parameters into a single parameter: You may find it helpful to show all 3 parameters directly in your visualization. Interpret Explain the general trends you see in your visualization. Use both your visualization and the sens_results data frame to identify what parameter combinations nullify the observed causal effect (at least approximately). Based on these results, comment on the robustness of the original causal effect estimate. Describe what background research you might need to conduct to contextualize how realistic the nullifying parameters are. Causal discovery (REQD) Exercise 1 Consider data that truly come from a fork X &lt;- Y -&gt; Z. What pattern would a causal discovery algorithm report? If you could supply prior knowledge to the algorithm on only one edge that is required to be present, what edge (if any) would allow the entire structure to be learned? Explain briefly. Exercise 2 We have learned the following structure from the skeleton building phase. We have the following results from conditional independence tests (\\(H_0\\) indicates conditional independence, significance level = 0.01): \\(X \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp Z \\mid Y\\)? p-value = 0.001 \\(X \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp W \\mid Y\\)? p-value = 0.1 \\(Y \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp V \\mid W\\)? p-value = 0.1 \\(U \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp W \\mid V\\)? p-value = 0.1 What pattern would a causal discovery algorithm report? Show your work. Exercise 3 We have measured 3 variables \\(X\\), \\(Y\\), and \\(Z\\) (all quantitative). You can read in the data below. disc_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/moj3k3fed7puicr/discovery_data.csv?dl=1&quot;) Step through the causal discovery process, using regression models as your conditional independence test. Use a type 1 error rate (significance level) of \\(\\alpha=0.01\\). Show all work. This involves: Showing model output. Writing a sentence using numbers from the output at each step to show the decisions made by the algorithm. Report the final output that the discovery algorithm would give. Simulation study for sensitivity analyses Conduct a simulation where the true average causal effect is zero but where there is an unmeasured confounder with U-&gt;A and U-&gt;Y effect magnitudes that you set. Use the tipr package to investigate if sensitivity analysis results align with your simulation setup. (You’ll have to look through the package documentation to find the right sensitivity analysis function.) Learning about mediation analysis Mediation analysis was a topic that we were going to talk about on Monday, March 20. We may come back to it after we finish the other topics on our schedule, but if you’d like to learn a little more about this topic, check out the following resources: YouTube video (with slides) Overview paper: Nguyen, T.

Psychological Methods. https://doi.org/10.1037/met0000299 Randomized experiments This exercise can help work through the idea that randomized experiments are the “gold standard” for causal inference. Simulate data from a fork structure where U is a common cause of A and Y. In the part of your code when you simulate Y, also simulate the potential outcomes under treatment and control (Ya1 and Ya0) by setting the A part equal to 1 for Ya1 and 0 for Ya0. Create a new version of treatment called A_rand which is a randomly assigned treatment (in contrast to naturally-occurring treatment A which is affected by Z) using the sample() function: # This randomly assigns half of the units to treatment and half to control A_rand &lt;- sample(rep(c(0,1), each = n/2)) # n is the simulation sample size Check whether marginal exchangeability holds for the natural version of treatment A. Repeat for the randomized version of treatment A_rand. Summarize what you learn from these investigations.
