**Motivation and Review** <a id="gq-motivation-review"></a>

- Let's think about the word "cause" (and related phrases like "results in" and "leads to.") What do you think "cause" means? How do you/people you know use it in day-to-day conversation and thinking?
- Why do we want to learn about causes? What should our goals be in learning about causes?
- "Correlation does not imply causation." Has this saying come up in conversations occasionally? If so, how? How do you feel about the value of this saying?
