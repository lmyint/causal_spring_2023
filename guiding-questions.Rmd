**Motivation and Review** <a id="gq-motivation-review"></a>

- Let's think about the word "cause" (and related phrases like "results in" and "leads to.") What do you think "cause" means? How do you/people you know use it in day-to-day conversation and thinking?
- Why do we want to learn about causes? What should our goals be in learning about causes?
- "Correlation does not imply causation." Has this saying come up in conversations occasionally? If so, how? How do you feel about the value of this saying?

**Exchangeability** <a id="gq-exchangeability"></a>

- Is the definition of a potential outcome and a causal effect satisfying to you? How do these notions relate to what you had thought about causes and causation previously? (Reflect on and connect to our Day 1 activity.)
- Let's think about exchangeability in big picture terms. Setting aside the technical definitions in terms of (conditional) independence, what is exchangeability trying to describe? Try to find a good word/phrase (not "independent") to complete the following sentence: "If the treated and untreated groups are exchangeable, we could also describe them as being ..."
- How can we use the concepts of marginal and conditional exchangeability to make statements about potential outcome distributions in the treated and in the untreated?
- Marginal and conditional exchangeability are **assumptions**--do you think these assumptions are testable using data? Why or why not?

**Study Designs** <a id="gq-study-designs"></a>

- Why are randomized experiments often called the "gold standard" for causal inference? What is the relationship between randomized experiments and exchangeability?
- Consider the quasi-experimental designs discussed in the video. How do these designs try to mimic randomization? What assumptions do they make to allow making statements about missing potential outcomes?
